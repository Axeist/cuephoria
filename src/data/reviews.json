    "text": "\"I really enjoy the immersion and how smooth the VR gameplay feels here. The current titles are high quality and very fun to play. I'm giving it 4 stars because I'd love to see a much larger selection of games added to the library. Adding more genres like horror, sports, or more multiplayer options would make this a perfect 5-star experience for me. Can't wait for more updates!\""
